      <h4> <a href = "https://github.com/treespaceNYC/orderedTrees">Treespace</a> </h4>

      <p>I am a research assistant at the research foundation at CUNY (1 Year). I work on ordered binary trees, more specifically, the goal of our research is to write an algorithm to find the similarities between two binary trees.</p>

      <h4> <a href = "https://github.com/huntercodefest/hunter-codefest-2022-unathletico-heights"> Board Game Recommendation Project </a> </h4>
      <p>For codefest 2022 at CUNY Hunter College, I worked on a web application that recommends boards games based on criteria such as age range and number of players. We then took this user input and calculated multi-dimensional distance formula on all of the games that we had in our database of board games to recommend games. We compiled this database by running a webscraper on over 100,000 webpages. </p>
