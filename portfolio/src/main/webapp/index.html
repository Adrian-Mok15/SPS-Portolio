      <p>For codefest 2022 at CUNY Hunter College, I worked on a web application that recommends boards games based on criteria such as age range and number of players. We then took this user input and calculated multi-dimensional distance formula on all of the games that we had in our database of board games to recommend games. We compiled this database by running a webscraper on over 100,000 webpages. </p>
